	<h1>Current Status</h1>
		<body><p>Colour theory has not developed an explicit explanation of how specific media affect color appearance: colors have always been defined in the abstract, and whether the colors were inks or paints, oils or watercolors, transparencies or reflecting prints, computer displays or movie theaters, was not considered especially relevant.[11] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albers">Josef Albers</a> investigated the effects of relative contrast and color saturation on the illusion of transparency, but this is an exception to the rule.</p>
